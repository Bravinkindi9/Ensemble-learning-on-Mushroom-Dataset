### Problem Statement
#### You are a data scientist / AI engineer working on a binary classification problem. You have been provided with a dataset named "mushroom_classification.csv", which includes various features of mushrooms to predict whether they are edible or poisonous. The dataset comprises the following columns:

- cap_diameter: The diameter of the mushroom cap.
- cap_shape: The shape of the mushroom cap, encoded as integers.
- gill_attachment: The attachment of the gills, encoded as integers.
- gill_color: The color of the gills, encoded as integers.
- stem_height: The height of the mushroom stem.
- stem_width The width of the mushroom stem.
- stem_color: The color of the mushroom stem, encoded as integers.
- season: The season when the mushroom was found, encoded as integers.
- class: The classification of the mushroom, where 0 indicates edible and 1 indicates poisonous.

Your task is to use this dataset to build and evaluate a binary classification model to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. You will start with basic models and gradually move towards advanced models like Gradient Boosting. Finally, you will explore various parameters of the Gradient Boosting model to enhance performance.
